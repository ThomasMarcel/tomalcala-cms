Hey,

I'm in the middle of redesigning this webapp. The first iteration looked very much like what a backend developer would do, so really unattractive. Now I'm trying to take lessons from websites I like and concept designs. This reminds me of a Twitter joke by the great Ken Wheeler that killed me about the Slack logo redesign that happened not long ago, and the average backend dev's inherent talent for beautiful designs:

Who knew that tweaking buttons and navbars from the original CSS framework would make so much difference! (probably every designer...)

Anyway, I'm on it, so you'll see what I can come up with soon.

Cheers!
