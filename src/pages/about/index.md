### This Guy
I am a French/Mexican father, full stack developer, CTO @ [EEVET](https://eevet.com), usually working with MEAN/MERN, LEMP/LAMP (the P stands for Python, mostly), LEMR stacks. Some Machine Learning. Some Startups.  

_My Vim, Neovim configurations and shell profiles for bash, zsh and fish are getting refined as hell. Those are my main tools._  

__Always learning!!__ _Sometimes teaching._

### This Project
This is going to be my personal blog and sandbox. It's currently built
with Gatsby/React and GraphQL, and deployed on Netlify with some neat
Continuous Deployment.  

Part of it is written in Reason(ML) and ReasonReact. I'll port more
existing components and add new ones as time goes.

### Those Technologies
_This kind of developer is enabled by..._  

* Linux
* MacOS

* Vim, Neovim, Oni, with MacVim, Spacevim and vimR too (different flavors,
  different projects)
* Kitty, iTerm2, Hyper
* __Go Fish!!__ (the fish shell), zsh, bash
* React, Angular
* Reason, Typescript
* Ruby, Python, sometimes PHP
* Cool free or cheap deployment hosts and tools
* The internet, nice tech news, podcasts, GitHub subscription and
  discovery, to stay informed
