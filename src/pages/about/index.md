### Me
I am a French/Mexican full stack developer, usually working with MEAN/MERN, LEMP/LAMP (P stands for Python, mostly), LEMR stacks.

Lately I'm really into ReasonML, so I'll definitely post some stuff
about it soon.

### This Project
This is going to be my personal blog and sandbox. It's currently build
with Gatsby/React and GraphQL, and deployed on Netlify with some neat
Continuous Deployment.

__It's all made with Vim because it's the natural order of things.__
